# MaverickBot
Simple Bot I coded using python3 and its modules after learning from Youtube
Feel free to add improvements and to point out my mistakes :)

Here are the the libraries I used (along with links to them + Linux commands for installing them)
- [gTTS](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gTTS) ```pip3 install gtts```
- [mpg123](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mpg123/0.4) ```pip3 install mpg123```
- [SpeechRecognition](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SpeechRecognition/
) ```pip3 install SpeechRecognition```
- [webbrowser](https://docs.python.org/3/library/webbrowser.html) ```pip3 install webbrowser```
- [PyAudio](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyAudio) ```apt-get install python3-pyaudio```

I successfully tested the bot on a system running Debian 9.3 (amd64) 

Have a great day!
